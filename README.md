🧱 Mix Design Calculator (GUI App)
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for Concrete Mix Design based on the provisions of IS 10262:2019 and IS 456:2000.
The app simplifies the process of determining the proportion of cement, water, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate required to achieve the desired concrete strength.


🚀 Features
Interactive GUI built with Tkinter (Python standard library)
Follows IS 10262:2019 mix design procedure

Calculates:
Target mean strength
Water-cement ratio
Cement content
Coarse and fine aggregate proportions
Volume and weight-based mix design
Option to use plasticizers or admixtures
Displays and exports results neatly
Includes About window and custom icon


📂 Files Included
main.py — Main Python script
tables.xlsx — Data file for design tables (as per IS codes)
about.png — Image for About section
icon.ico — Application icon
README.md — Project documentation
